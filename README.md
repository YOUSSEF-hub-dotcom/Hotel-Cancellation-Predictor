# Hotel-Cancellation-Predictor
## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting hotel booking cancellations using a Random Forest Classifier.The project analyze a dataset with 36 features, including lead time,arrival data, and special requests, to identify patterns leading to revenue loss due to cancellations.
## Objective
Predict the likelihood of booking cancellations (binary classifications).
Achive an optimized model with an accuracy of 80.7%.
Provide insights into key factors affecting cancellations through feature importance analysis.
## Tools & Technologies
**Language**:Python
**Libraries**:pandas,scikit-learn,matplotlib,seaborn
**Model**:Random Forest Classifier
## Methodology
**Data Preprocessing**:Handled missing values and encoded categrical variable (e.g.,arrival_data_month)
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:Identified lead time and previous cancellatins as significant factors.
**Model Training**:Trained a Random Forest model with 100 estimators, achieving 80.7% accuracy.
**Evaluation**:Assessed performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and feature importance.
## Results
Accuracy: 80.7%
Key Insight: Lead time emerged as the most influential feature (importance:0.440585)
